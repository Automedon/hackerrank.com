Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as: code, log files, spreadsheets, documents, etc.

We can match a specific string  in a test string  by making our regex pattern . This is one of the simplest patterns. However, in the coming challenges, we'll see how well we can match more complex patterns and learn about their syntax.

Task

You have a test string . Your task is to match the string hackerrank. This is case sensitive.

Note

This is a regex only challenge. You are not required to write code.
You only have to fill in the regex pattern in the blank (_________).
