Objective

In this challenge, we learn about iterating over objects. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Complete the function in the editor. It has one parameter: an array, , of objects. Each object in the array has two integer properties denoted by  and . The function must return a count of all such objects  in array  that satisfy .

Input Format

The first line contains an integer denoting . 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the values of  and .

Constraints

Output Format

Return a count of the total number of objects  such that . Locked stub code in the editor prints the returned value to STDOUT.

There are  objects in the  array:

Because we have two objects  that satisfy  (i.e.,  and ), we return  as our answer.

/*
 * Return a count of the total number of objects 'o' satisfying o.x == o.y.

 * Parameter(s):
 * objects: an array of objects with integer properties 'x' and 'y'

function getCount(objects) {
    return objects.filter((v,i)=>v.x==objects[i].y).length
