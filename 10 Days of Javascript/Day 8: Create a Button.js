Task

Complete the code in the editor so that it creates a clickable button satisfying the following properties:

The button's id is btn.
The button's initial text label is . After each click, the button must increment by . Recall that the button's text label is the JS object's innerHTML property.
The button has the following style properties:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/button.css" type="text/css">
    </head>
    
    <body>
    	<script src="js/button.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
