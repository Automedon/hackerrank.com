/*
Objective

In this challenge, we practice using arrow functions. Check the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Complete the function in the editor. It has one parameter: an array, . It must iterate through the array performing one of the following actions on each element:

If the element is even, multiply the element by .
If the element is odd, multiply the element by .
The function must then return the modified array.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the size of . 
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective elements of .

Constraints

, where  is the  element of .
Output Format

Return the modified array where every even element is doubled and every odd element is tripled.

Sample Input 0

1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 0

3 4 9 8 15
Explanation 0

Given , we modify each element so that all even elements are multiplied by  and all odd elements are multipled by . In other words, . We then return the modified array as our answer.
